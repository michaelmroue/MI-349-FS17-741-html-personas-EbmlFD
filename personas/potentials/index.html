        work for Space Standard Technology."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="listed">
      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <p>Joe Mann wants to find a company to work for. He is lacking experience,(he just graduated) but he has quality credentials. We should reach out to him for an interview.</p><br>
      <h3>Attitude</h3>
      <p>Joe is looking for a reputable company, one that he believes he can offer valuable input in day to day operations. He's interested in Space Standard Tech. and based on credentials, should be
      in constant communication with our recruiter to determine if he's a good fit. Our website should have a messaging feautre, and quality UI tools for our recruiters to utilize. It will also make us seem
      more engaged, and interested from Joe's perspective.</p>
      <h3>Behavior</h3>
      <p>Joe is haste in his decisions. He has student loans to pay and is eager to start making money. That being said, if we don't respond quickly, we could use a valuable employee. This goes back to
      our messaging system. With millenials now entering the work force, we must our interface fresh and attractive to new graduates. That being said, we must also keep experienced potentials in mind, and keep
      an elegant, simple design. </p>
