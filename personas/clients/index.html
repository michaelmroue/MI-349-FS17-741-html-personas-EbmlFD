    <h3>Descriptor</h3>
    <p>John Smith from Boeing</p>
    <p>Age: 32, Works at Boeing HQ as a senior engineer. Is constantly working and completes projects before deadline.</p>

  <div class="quote">
    <h3>Quote</h3>
    <p>"Would you be able to manufacture 7000 of these units before the end of the month?"</p>
  </div>
  <div class="listed">
    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <p>John Smith wants to find a company to develop the parts needed for his project. He's a senior level engineer, so he knows the industry well and won't tolerate anything but the best.</p><br>
    <h3>Attitude</h3>
    <p>John is looking for a reputable company, one that takes pride in their quality. In this field, even the smallest error can have catastrophic results. That being said if our website is professional
    and we show other big name companies we've worked with, it will let John know we mean business.</p>
    <h3>Behavior</h3>
    <p>John is very methodical, when he looks for companies to work with he also looks at their competitors, and searches for positive and negative reviews on past work. It would be a good idea to include
    pages to our competitors, along with information on how we're better than them. It would also be smart to show any reviews we have regarding our past work, highlighting the positive ones, but also showing
    how we righted our wrongs in the negative reviews.</p>
