      <h3>Descriptor</h3>
      <p>Mark Jones, recruiter at Space Standard Technology</p>
      <p>Age: 33, has been with the compnay for 6 years, has loads of experience in the field, and knows our team very well, allowing to make the right decision
      on potential hires.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="quote">
      <h3>Quote</h3>
      <p>"Even though we have a quality team of engineers, we're always looking for new employees that mesh well, to help us expand and take on more projects."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="listed">
      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <p>Mark Jones wants to find and filter through resumes. It would be easier for him to do this if he could directly message each respondant if he has further questions.</p><br>
      <h3>Attitude</h3>
      <p>Mark is also very methodical like John. He also has experience, and because he's worked with us for so long knows what does and doesn't fit. That being said, when Mark is using
      our website or other recruiting platforms, he gathers as much information as he can on the potential, and forms a conclusion after careful analysis.</p><br>
      <h3>Behavior</h3>
      <p>On other sites, Mark is productive, however, he has a few tips to improve our sites hiring features. Besides the messaging system he suggests adding a database to store
      the information. This allows better organization, having a specific folder for each person, but also allows to look back and reach out to people we might not have had space for before.</p><br>
